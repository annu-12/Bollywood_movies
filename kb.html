<p><h1>Critic Reviews</h1></p>
<p><h3>The film received mixed reviews, with criticism directed at it for glamorising misogyny and toxic masculinity.Nitya Prakash writing for Bombay Weekly rated the film with four out of five stars and finds it "visually compelling" having "haunting performances" and "nuanced writing". Praising cinematography, Kapoor's acting and score, he said, "Kabir Singh" is not a film; it's an experience that’ll stay with you." Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying,"While Kabir Singh is a welcome change from stereotypical love stories, this kind of love affair needs some getting used to. Through his protagonist, Sandeep bets all his cards on his leading man, making sure you either love him or hate him, but you can't ignore him."Trade analyst and critic Taran Adarsh concurred with Kotecha on the film being an unconventional story and rated it three and half stars out of five. Declaring it "powerful", he praised Vanga's storytelling and Kapoor's performance. He felt that the film was a newfangled romantic tale.
<br>
<br>
Priyanka Sinha Jha of CNN-News18, praising Kapoor's performance, Vanga's story and direction, rated the film with three and a half stars out of five. She found editing and soulful music of the film appealing. She felt that the film was a rare story of star-crossed lovers which moves the audience. In the end, She says, "Reddy despite a brooding despairing protagonist takes things many notches higher and makes it one helluva trippy ride."[45] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare said, "At 172 minutes, the film is too long by modern standards. Thankfully, Vanga has gone for a non-linear mode of storytelling and going back and forth in the timeline does keep the viewer engrossed."
<br>
<br>
Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express giving the film one-and-a-half stars out of five, opined, "Kabir Singh (protagonist) is all flourish, mostly surface. You see him going through the motions, but you never really feel for him. And that, right there, is the problem: not enough pay off for three hours of pain."Raja Sen of Hindustan Times, agreeing with Gupta, gave one-and-a-half stars out of five and felt that it was the most misogynistic Indian film that had come in a long time. He praised the cinematography of Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran but criticised the other aspects of the film. He said, "Kabir Singh actually applauds its pathetic protagonist, and ends up an obnoxious celebration of toxic masculinity."Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror rated the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, feeling that trimming the script by forty minutes would have helped.
<br>
<br>
Sandipan Sharma, writing for Firstpost, praised and defended the film, saying, "filmmakers should have the right to explore the mind of a flawed person." He slammed the critics for their orthodox remarks and terming the film as "glorifying misogyny, portraying toxic masculinity, obsessive love, celebrating alcoholism, etc." He further added "If Kabir Singh were to inspire Indian men to turn into alcoholics, raging maniacs, would it be safe to assume that in a few years we’d see a full generation of youngsters inspired by biopics and our prime minister? [...] his tragi-comic story is so entertaining. Somewhere deep down it also reminds us of our own struggles, failures and flaws."
<br>
<br>
In response to criticism of Kabir being portrayed as a misogynist, Kapoor defended the character, saying, "There are all kinds of people in real life, including alpha-males who feel territorial entitlement, and I have played this character truthfully".</h3></p>

<p><h1>Plot</h1></p>
<p><h3>Kabir Rajdheer Singh is a house surgeon at Delhi Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe anger management problems that earn the wrath of the dean of the college. Kabir's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a college bully. After having a brawl with Amit, one of the team members from another college alongside his friend Kamal against other members of the opposing team who ridiculed them during an inter-college football match, the dean asks Kabir to either apologise or leave the college. Kabir initially chooses to leave, but stays back after meeting and falling in love with first-year student Preeti Sikka.
<br>
<br>
Kabir and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Kabir is in love with Preeti and asserts that she is exclusive to him. Initially afraid, Preeti starts adjusting herself to Kabir's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings and they develop an intimate relationship. Kabir graduates with an MBBS degree and leaves for Mussoorie to pursue a Master's degree in orthopaedic surgery. Over three years both come back to Mumbai to their respective homes but Kabir's and Preeti's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Kabir visits Preeti's house in Mumbai, where her father, Harpal, sees them kissing and throws Kabir out.
<br>
<br>
Harpal opposes Preeti and Kabir's relationship since he dislikes Kabir's personality. Kabir demands that Preeti must decide within six hours otherwise he will end their relationship. By the time she manages to visit Kabir's house, he is drunk, injects morphine into himself, and becomes unconscious for two days, even missing his elder brother Karan's wedding in the process. Preeti is then forcibly married to another man named Jatinder from her caste. Kabir learns about the marriage from Shiva and goes to her house in protest. He is assaulted and gets arrested for making a scene. Kabir's father, Rajdheer, ostracises him from the family home for damaging his reputation.
<br>
<br>
With Shiva's help, Kabir finds a rented apartment and joins a private hospital as a surgeon. To cope with his emotions, he starts taking drugs, attempts one-night stands, buys a pet dog and names it after Preeti, and drinks alcohol; all of which are unsuccessful. Within months, he becomes a successful surgeon and a high-functioning alcoholic who is feared by the hospital's staff members, one of the reasons being his high surgery count. Kabir's self-destructing behaviour and refusal to move on worries Shiva and Kamal. He persuades one of his patients, Jia Sharma, a leading film star, to have a no-strings relationship with him, which he ends when she falls in love with him.
<br>
<br>
On a day off, Kabir unwillingly agrees to perform a life-saving surgery. During the surgery, he collapses with dehydration. The hospital staff examine his blood samples, which show traces of alcohol and cocaine. The hospital chief files a case against Kabir, who accepts the truth on the grounds of violating his professional ethics during an in-house court hearing, despite Shiva and Karan making arrangements to bail him out. Kabir's medical licence is cancelled for five years and he is evicted from the flat. The next morning, Shiva manages to reach Kabir to convey his grandmother Sadhna Kaur's death; he meets with his father, and they reconcile. Kabir gives up his self-destructive habits soon after.
<br>
<br>
While leaving for a vacation, Kabir sees a pregnant Preeti sitting in a park. Convinced that she is unhappy with her marriage, Kabir meets with her along with Shiva after returning from his vacation. Preeti, at first, refuses to listen or talk to Kabir but Shiva tells her why Kabir could not accept her earlier. Convinced, Preeti reveals that she left Jatinder three days after their marriage and continued to work in a clinic. She tells Kabir that he is the child's father, and they reunite. The pair marries, and Harpal apologises for misunderstanding their love for each other. The movie ends off with the couple on the beach with their baby, after having their wedding photos taken along with Kabir's family.</h3></p>
