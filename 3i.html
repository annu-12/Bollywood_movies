<p><h1>Critic Reviews</h1></p>
<p><h3>Subhash K. Jha stated: "It's not that 3 Idiots is a flawless work of art. But it is a vital, inspiring and life-revising work of contemporary art with some heart imbued into every part. In a country where students are driven to suicide by their impossible curriculum, 3 Idiots provides hope. Maybe cinema can't save lives. But cinema, sure as hell, can make you feel life is worth living. 3 Idiots does just that, and much more. The director takes the definition of entertainment into directions of social comment". Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave it four and a half stars and suggests that, "The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas […] Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munna Bhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track."Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave the film three and a half out of five stars and comments that "this is the sort of movie you'll take home with a smile and a song on your lips."Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 3 Idiots four and a half out of five stars and states: "On the whole, 3 Idiots easily ranks amongst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favour: Watch 3 Idiots. It's emotional, it's entertaining, it's enlightening. The film has tremendous youth appeal and feel-good factor to work in a big way." Kaveree Bamzai of India Today gave 3 Idiots five stars and argues that "it's a lovely story, of a man from nowhere who wanted to learn, told like a fairy tale, with the secret heart carrying its coded message of setting all of us free."
<br>
<br>
Sonia Chopra of Sify gave the film 3 stars and said "Though a bit too calculated and designed, 3 Idiots is still an ok option for the significant message, interesting cast and scattered breezy moments."Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three out of five stars and states: "Going home after watching 3 Idiots I felt like I'd just been to my favorite restaurant only to be a tad under-whelmed by their signature dish. It was a satisfying meal, don't get me wrong, but not the best meal I'd been expecting."Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express also gave it 3 stars, stating "'3 Idiots' does not do as much for me. The emotional truth that shone through both the 'Munnabhai' movies doesn't come through strongly enough."Raja Sen of Rediff gave the film two out of five stars and states: "Rajkumar Hirani's one of the directors of the decade, a man with immense talent and a knack for storytelling. On his debut, he hit a hundred. With his second, he hit a triple century. This time, he fishes outside the offstump, tries to play shots borrowed from other batters, and hits and misses to provide a patchy, 32*-type innings. It's okay, boss, *chalta hai*. Even Sachin has an off day, and we still have great hope."</h3></p>

<p><h1>Plot</h1></p>
<p><h3>Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi begin their college year in the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. They are joined by Ranchoddas Chanchad, nicknamed "Rancho", as their roommate. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an attempt to end his family's poverty. Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate in science and engineering. He believes in hands-on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, resulting in him coming into conflict with the professors, particularly the institution's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe, whom the ICE community nicknames "Virus". Virus's traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur, nicknamed “Silencer", is an arrogant student with little knowledge of Hindi, who is obsessed with topping the exams and invariably learns by rote.
<br>
<br>
Sometime later, the trio finds that a student named Joy Lobo committed suicide by hanging himself; Which was caused by depression after Virus informs Joy's father that Joy would be unable to graduate that year due to a delay in his submission of an assignment. Joy had taken longer as he wanted to perfect his breakthrough drone design of a quad-copter, and also due to a break on account of his father's brief illness. Rancho criticizes Virus' method of teaching and tries to show him how much pressure engineers face when they study, angering him further. Rancho visits his friends' families, and later, the trio then gatecrashes a wedding to eat good food. They meet and befriend Pia, who turns out to be Virus' daughter and a resident student at the city's hospital. Rancho advises Pia not to marry her fiancée Suhas Tandon because he’s madly obsessed with expensive jewelry, brands, and prices. Rancho gives Pia a demo on Suhas’ attitude by spilling mint sauce on his shoes to annoy him. When Virus spots the trio, he summons Farhan and Raju on the next working day and tells them of consequences of being friends with Rancho by comparing their families' incomes. He tells them that Rancho comes from a very rich family and does not need to worry about getting good grades and making a career. Affected, Raju moves out and into Chatur's room. During the Teachers Day celebration, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified by Rancho and as a result, he bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful. Sometime later, Pia is at the mall with Suhas and spots Rancho with an invention named after Virus; The Virus Inverter. Rancho explains to Pia that he dislikes the way her father teaches his students and that they end up lame like Suhas. Rancho plays a prank on Suhas, pretending that Pia lost her watch, to prove that Suhas shows more value to expensive stuff rather than her. Fed up with Suhas’ behavior, she tells him off. Rancho and Pia save Raju's dying father; Raju reconciles with his friends while Pia falls in love with Rancho.
<br>
<br>
One night during their senior year, Farhan and Raju are upset that they’re trailing behind in their grades every year and that Rancho is always in the front of every school picture. Farhan exposes Rancho of not telling Pia that he is in love with her and hasn't told her for the past four years. The three friends drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhe residence so that Rancho can propose to Pia. As the trio escape, Virus recognizes Raju and, on the next day, threatens to expel him unless he writes a letter recommending Rancho for expulsion. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide and ends up in a coma. With intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just in time for his first job interview on the campus, which he succeeds in cracking. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favourite wildlife photographer Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as an assistant. On Rancho's advice, he communicates his dream to his father, who though reluctant at first, gives his blessings for the sake of his son's happiness.
<br>
<br>
Infuriated by this and Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final exam paper to fail Raju, wherein Pia tries to help the trio by revealing to them the location of the exam paper in her father's office; unfortunately, Virus finds out and expels them. Pia confronts Virus about her brother who had committed suicide because he couldn't meet Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night, Virus' pregnant elder daughter Mona goes into labour during a heavy storm that cuts off all traffic and electricity in the city. Rancho and the other students help them by using their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a vacuum cleaner into a ventouse and deliver the baby with the help of Pia over a video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student and revokes their expulsion. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears shortly after the ceremony ends.
<br>
<br>
Ten years later, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, while Raju is married and settled with his family in a comfortable lifestyle with a corporate job and Chatur is the vice-president of a reputable corporation in the United States; none among the three of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Reuniting at the ICE campus, they travel to Shimla, where Rancho was spotted in the background of a snapshot. Upon arrival, they meet a man who turns out to be the real Ranchoddas Chanchad (Javed Jaffrey). From him, they learn that the Rancho they knew was actually "Chhote", the son of the gardener who was a servant to the Chanchad family. Ranchoddas' father arranged for Chhote to attend ICE in his son's name so that his son could take credit for the degree. Ranchoddas provides Chhote's address in Ladakh, where he is a schoolteacher. On the way, they pass Manali where they rescue and prevent Pia from marrying Suhas, who is now a changed man but reverts to his old ways when Raju, disguised as the housekeeping man, puts mint sauce on his wedding jacket, making Raju run away from the wedding in his attire. Chatur, meanwhile, is in a hurry to crack a business deal with world-renowned scientist and businessman with 400 patents to his name, Phunsukh Wangdu.
<br>
<br>
Upon arrival in Ladakh, the four head to the village school and witness the young students' inventions that resemble Rancho's college projects. The four happily reunite with Rancho to which Pia and Rancho kiss, while Chatur insults and asks Rancho to sign a contract stating that he is the least successful person; Rancho does so without commenting. As Chatur walks away triumphantly, Rancho reveals himself to be Phunsukh Wangdu, to his friends' and Pia's surprise and delight. Realizing this, a horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and pleads him to sign his contract while Rancho and his friends run away laughing. In the end, Phunsukh Wangdu tells everyone his theory: "Follow excellence and success will by itself follow you"</h3></p>
