<p><h1>Critic Reviews</h1></p>
<p><h3>Wake Up Sid was well received by a number of critics. Subhash K. Jha gave Wake Up Sid a rave review stating that it is, "a triumph on many levels [...] Ayan Mukherjee takes the age-old dramatic conflicts of our commercial cinema into understated corridors."[11] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film three out of five stars, stating that Wake Up Sid "has its heart in the right place and marks the breakout of a bright, shining star who has come into his own so early in his acting career. Watch it, and be awestruck by Ranbir."Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out of five stars as well as a "thumbs up" stating that it is "strongly recommended."
<br>
<br>
Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave it 3.5 out of four stars and states, "Wake Up Sid belongs to a sweet genre that, without doubt, flows on from Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai: part Hollywood; part Bollywood; mostly coming-of-age; subtly romantic; largely original; authentic in feel; light in weight; English in expression; Hindi in language."Avijit Ghosh of The Times of India gave it three and half out of four stars and suggests that, "Wake Up Sid becomes a sort of template of how GenNow navigate their lives: deal with their own little rebellions, find meaning to their own definitions of independence and handle their own set of mistakes. It feels good when the two friends finally meet in driving rain under the grey skies by the sea. Refreshing and heart-warming, Wake Up Sid really puts you in the mood for love."Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave it three and half out of five stars and praised the director saying, "Ayan Mukerji arrives in style and manages to leave his own mark on the film despite having a producer like Karan Johar whose other productions always tend to have his stamp. Wake Up Sid really puts you in the mood for love."
<br>
<br>
Joginder Tuteja of the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) calls the film "flawless" and gave it three and a half stars. He states: "There are five things that make Wake Up Sid a delightful affair. It has a constant flow throughout; no over the top or understated drama; no ultra emotional strangulation of audiences; absolutely no yuppie cool dude act; and last but not the least, this is an original and refreshing story."[17] Rachel Saltz of The New York Times argues that: "With no big production numbers (songs play over montage sequences), a quiet style and credible characters, Wake Up Sid is Bollywood in an indie mood, a film for people like Aisha and Sid: young and educated. It may not be as hip as Bombay Beat, the magazine where the two work, but it shows that Mr. Mukherji is a director to watch."
<br>
<br>
In one point of criticism, Sudhish Kamath of Chennai's The Hindu labeled the closing moments as a "stock ending" and noted that, despite the film's overall effectiveness, the ending "leaves you a little disappointed."Variety's Joe Leydon found the film "instantly forgettable", but praised the performances of Kapoor and Sharma, as well noting how "effortlessly appealing" the movie is, stating: "...this atypically low-key Bollywood romantic comedy somehow manages to remain pleasantly diverting throughout its 138-minute running time."</h3></p>

<p><h1>Plot</h1></p>
<p><h3>Sidharth "Sid" Mehra (Ranbir Kapoor) is the carefree son of wealthy businessman Ram Mehra (Anupam Kher) and Sarita (Supriya Pathak) in Mumbai. Depicted as a spoiled slacker, Sid shows little concern for his plans after college, barely studying for tests and having no interest in working for his father. At the farewell party after the final exams, he meets Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), an aspiring writer recently moved away from her hometown of Calcutta, who happens to be one of his college mate's roommate. They decide to go for a small walk and strike a chord instantly. With the help of Sid, along with his friends Rishi (Namit Das) and Laxmi (Shikha Talsania), Aisha finds a small apartment overlooking the city skyline. She also lands a job at Mumbai Beat (based on Time Out! Mumbai), a hip magazine run by editor-in-chief Kabir (Rahul Khanna), to whom Aisha is instantly attracted.
<br>
<br>
Soon afterward, Sid learns that he has failed the final exams, being the only one among his friends to have not cleared the exams. Sid displaces his frustration onto Rishi and later gets into a heated argument with his parents, ending with him hastily moving out. Aisha allows Sid to temporarily stay at her apartment but finds him disorganized and careless with her home. One night, Aisha loses her temper and yells at Sid for his inability to look after himself. The next morning, Sid confides in Aisha that he now realizes his constant dependence on his father's wealth, a realization that persuades him to seek work. Aisha helps him land a job as a photography intern – photography has been an interest of his since childhood – at Mumbai Beat.
<br>
<br>
The internship slowly motivates Sid to be more responsible and productive. He helps out with chores, an internal change visible to all around him. He reconciles with Rishi when they meet again for the first time since their fight. Sid eventually gets hired full-time at Mumbai Beat and receives his first paycheck. He immediately goes to visit his father to show him the paycheque and he nostalgically asks Sid to return home. In the meantime, Aisha and Kabir start dating, but she quickly realizes that, despite her initial attraction to him, they have very little in common. Aisha also dislikes Sid's closeness with the designing intern Tanya (Kainaz Motivala). This leads Aisha to develop feelings for Sid, and on the day he packs his belongings to move back in with his family, she is furious to hear that he is leaving. Confused and hurt, unaware that Aisha has fallen in love with him, Sid makes his departure.
<br>
<br>
Back at home, Sid keeps thinking about Aisha. He discovers that he has brought Aisha's shirt with his belongings. Sid wears her shirt and reminisces about her while Aisha at her home speaks to her parents as she feels lonely after Sid's departure. The next morning, Sid receives the latest issue of Mumbai Beat. He reads Aisha's column, an article describing her adjustment to life in Mumbai and her love for an unnamed person. Realizing that the article is about her feelings for him, Sid rushes through rainy weather to meet her at the seafront where they walked the day they met. Sid expresses his love for her and the two embrace.</h3></p>
