<p><h1>Critic Reviews</h1></p>
<p><h3>On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 33% based on 12 reviews with an average rating of 5.5/10.[34] The film received mixed reviews from critics.
<br>
<br>
Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gave the film three and a half stars out of five, and praised Hrithik Roshan, Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Srivastava and cinematography of Anay Goswami. She felt that Super 30 conveyed the message that though education is the privilege of people with good economic background, but, if given the level field others too can shine equally. Concluding, she wrote "While the narrative does have its flaws, Super 30 is a human drama and the story of a teacher who triumphs over the many challenges that life throws at him, to set an example for the world to see. Just for that it’s worth a watch."[35] Writing for the NDTV Saibal Chatterjee, rated it with two stars out of five and felt that erratic screenplay of Super 30 had 'skimmed the surface of a massive mound of tangled issues', and that Hrithik Roshan was miscast as Anand Kumar. He opined that the major problem with the film was telling a true story, which was not convincing. He concluded the review as, "The idea to bronze up Hrithik Roshan so that he can impersonate Anand Kumar is anything but super: it is a formula that equals zero." [36] Samrudhi Ghosh of India Today rated it with two and a half stars out of five, but praised the performances of Pankaj Tripathi and Aditya Srivastava. Ghosh felt the film was lengthy and had aroused the dramatics without need, saying "Under the guidance of math wizard Anand Kumar, his Super 30 turned out to be miracles. Under the guidance of Vikas Bahl, Hrithik Roshan's Super 30 is far from one."
<br>
<br>
Priyanka Sinha Jha of CNN-News18, disagreeing with Ghosh praises Roshan and ensemble of Pankaj Tripathi, Virendra Saxena, Nandish Sandhu and Aditya Srivastav for their performances. She feels that Roshan has given an admirable performance. Agreeing with Sengupta she opines that education is a means to a better life, but is a privilege in itself,and that is what the film questions and challenges. She rates the film with three stars out of five, and concludes, "After all, as the famous saying goes—“Not all superheroes wear capes.” Super 30 is the story of one such.."Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave two stars out of five and termed the film 'way less than super',she opined that if handled in right way, it would have been a 'rousing, goosebumps-inducing, cheer-athon.' She summarised by stating, "Yes, the real-life story is inspiring.But the telling of it is a drag. The film has its moments, which belong mostly to its young people: the kids are all right.</h3></p>

<p><h1>Plot</h1></p>
<p><h3>Anand Kumar is a lower-class student who has a passion in studies and is good at it. The local minister, proud of him, promises for help whenever needed. Anand Kumar also has a friend, Ritu Rashmi,with whom he spends time. Anand, every weekend, goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to solve a foreign Math journal. One day, the manager finally catches him, and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests him to get featured in an article on the newspaper, so that he becomes famous and will get free subscription of the journal. Anand goes to the post-office, where his father works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one had been able to solve. He then gets featured in the newspaper for solving some tough Math problems. He gets a letter from Professor Richard of Cambridge University to come there. But, Anand needs money to travel. He and his father go the local minister but he denies any promise. They both further try to have money but remain helpless, and get depressed. And one day, Anand's father dies of a heart attack. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and financial condition.
<br>
<br>
He then sells papads in the city. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, an assistant of the local minister. Lallan takes Anand as a teacher in his coaching centre, Excellence Coaching Centre. There, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. He thinks that these poor kids also have a right to study. Hence, he leaves Excellence and starts a separate tuition for poor kids, in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. He teaches them to learn everything practically and have the concepts clear in an easy and fun way. This all enrages Lallan, whose centre is facing criticism for not retaining Anand. In course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and mother. Lallan and the local minister plan to have Anand killed so that his kids won't be entering IIT. Anand is hurt brutally, and is hospitalised, on verge of death. Anand tells his students to then use their knowledge to defeat the goons sent by the minister, while he is being treated. The students, in unity, use their knowledge and defeat the goons and Anand is treated successfully. The students give the IIT exam and all 30 students pass successfully.</h3></p>
