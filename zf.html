<p><h1>Critic Reviews</h1></p>
<p><h3>The film received mixed reviews from critics. The Times of India gave 3.5 out of 5 stars stating "The Zoya Factor is a fun, frothy film that pits superstitions versus strategy and self-belief versus luck. And delightfully uses India’s cricket craze to deliver a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining film".Priyanka Sinha Jha of CNN-News18 gave 3.5 out of 5 stating that "With its quirky premise, The Zoya Factor is light and frothy just as romcoms should be, and ticks against all boxes especially the prerequisite combo of a tall, dark and handsome hero and a good-looking yet naïve heroine."
<br>
<br>
Bollywood Hungama rated it 3 out of 5 commenting that "The Zoya Factor is a feel-good popcorn entertainer that works chiefly due to concept, treatment, humour and performances."
<br>
<br>
The Indian Express gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating "For a rom-com which needs to be light on its feet, hitting fours and sixes as it goes along, the writing is not as supple as it should have been. Too many slog overs here".</h3></p>
<br>

<br>
<p><h1>Plot</h1></p>
<p><h3>Zoya Solanki (Sonam Kapoor) is a junior copywriter at an Advertising agency who considers herself very unlucky. Her love life and professional life reach an all time low when her rich dentist boyfriend (Rishi Hapawat) dumps her for being too infra dig, and her boss (Koel Purie) at the ad agency grows displeased with her inefficient work. But soon, her luck changes when she is sent to Srilanka to shoot an ad film with the Indian cricket team. Zoya accidentally meets Nikhil Khoda (Dulquer Salmaan), the Indian team captain who is a staunch believer of hardwork and against his team's dependence on superstitions. When Zoya gets invited to a breakfast with the team, they discover that she was born on the day when India won its first World Cup. This makes them believe that she could be their lucky mascot.
<br>
<br>
Her luck rubs off sensationally when the team wins the match in Sri Lanka. She is offered a position by the BCCI as official lucky mascot for the upcoming World Cup. This goes against the wishes of Captain Khoda who is attracted to Zoya but is also irritated by the media for giving her the credit for their wins. How Nikhil and Zoya cope with their differences and bring victory to team India form the crux of the story.</h3></p>
