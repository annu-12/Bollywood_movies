<p><h3>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (English: Sometimes Happiness, Sometimes Sorrow), also known as K3G, is a 2001 Indian family drama film written and directed by Karan Johar and produced by Yash Johar. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor, with Rani Mukerji appearing in an extended special appearance. The music was composed by Jatin Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava, with lyrics penned by Sameer and Anil Pandey. The background score was composed by Babloo Chakravarty. The film tells the story of an Indian family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower socio-economic group than them.
<br>
<br>
Development of the film began in 1998, soon after the release of Johar's debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). Principal photography began on 16 October 2000 in Mumbai and continued in London and Egypt. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was promoted with the tag-line "It's All About Loving Your Parents". Initially scheduled to release during the Diwali festivities of 2001, the film eventually released in India, United Kingdom and North America on 14 December 2001. In 2003, it became the first Indian film to be given a theatrical release in Germany. Upon release, the film met with mixed reviews from film critics and received polarising reactions to Karan Johar's "larger-than-life" directorial style, with some seeing it as an "oddly hollow film".
<br>
<br>
Made on a budget of ₹400 million (US$5.8 million), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... emerged as a major commercial success, both domestically and internationally, with a lifetime gross of ₹1.36 billion ($29 million) at the worldwide box office. Outside India, the film was the highest-grossing Indian film ever, until its record was broken by Johar's next directorial, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... won several awards at popular award ceremonies the following year, including five Filmfare Awards.</h3></p>

<p><h1>Critic Reviews</h1></p>
<p><h3>In India, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... met with polarised reactions from film critics. While certain critics praised the visual richness and the performances of the cast, certain others were negative about the lengthy run time and criticised the script strength and inconsistencies. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India applauded the film and reviewed, "K3G is the complete commercial banquet delivered with fabulous finesse by Karan Johar. So, go indulge yourself. Cry your heart out and surprisingly, you'll feel life's finally alive and kicking in Mumbai's dream world."Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the emotional sequences, as well as the choreography, production design, costumes, and cinematography. He added that Karan Johar was the real star, for creating many memorable sequences.Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying "Dharma Productions has kept its promise in giving us a lovable film to remember in coming times." He pointed out several flaws in the script, but added that the positive aspects of the film managed to outweigh the negative ones. He quoted, "K3G is one heck of an entertainer and was worth the wait".In the film review section of his book Bollywood: An Insider's Guide, Fuad Omar showered overwhelming praise on the film and called it a "masterpiece from the first frame to the last". In summary he said, "Overall Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... is without a doubt the most enthralling, entertaining, emotional and complete vision and definition of Hindi cinema I have ever seen. It is simply the perfect Hindi film."
<br>
<br>
Contrary to the positive reviews, Anjum N., writing for Rediff, said that despite an extraordinary cast and a big budget, "Karan Johar disappoints." He praised Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan's performance and noted Hrithik Roshan for holding his own against the veteran actors. However, in summary he called the film "a bad remix of Mohabbatein and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai".Writing for The Hindu, Ziya Salam praised Kajol's performance and Karan's ability to "keep the viewer occupied". She commented, "Watch Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... not because of the hype which preceded its release but because in these meagre times not many have come up with better fare. The film at least partially redeems the hope surrounding it. Again, just like its name. Some joy, some disappointment."Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave a mixed review and said that while the film "makes you laugh and cry alternately", the shenanigans were nevertheless "fake and affected" and "monochromatic despite the profusion of colours".</h3></p>

<p><h1>Plot</h1></p>
<p><h3>Yashvardhan "Yash" Raichand (Amitabh Bachchan) is a billionaire business tycoon living in Delhi with his wife Nandini (Jaya Bachchan) and two sons Rahul and Rohan. The Raichand household is highly patriarchal and strictly follows traditions. Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth. This is known to everyone in the household except Rohan.
<br>
<br>
Adult Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) returns home after completing his education abroad and falls in love with the vivacious Anjali Sharma (Kajol). However, their love is forbidden because Anjali is from a low-income background. During this time, Rohan, still a child, is sent to boarding school. Yash announces his desire for Rahul to marry Naina (Rani Mukherji), a high-society woman and Rahul's childhood friend, as Yash believes that parents have the right to choose their child's spouse. However, when he comes to know of Anjali, he is enraged due to her status, and Rahul promises not to marry her, as he does not want to hurt his father. However, Rahul discovers that Anjali's father (Alok Nath) has died, leaving behind Anjali and her kid sister Pooja. He spontaneously decides to marry her despite his father's hostility. When he brings Anjali home, Yash disowns Rahul, reminding him of his adopted status. Hurt by this, Rahul shares a tearful goodbye with Nandini and leaves home. Rohan never finds out the truth of why Rahul left home.
<br>
<br>
Ten years later, an adult Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) returns home from boarding school and finally learns from his grandmothers why Rahul left as well as the fact that he is actually adopted. Seeing the pain that this separation has brought upon his parents, Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and Pooja have moved to London, and travels there, lying to his parents that it is to pursue further studies. In London, Rahul and Anjali live happily with a young son, Krish, and Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a beautiful and ultra-modern diva studying at King's College London. Rohan and Pooja, who were childhood friends in the past after their elder siblings fell in love, reunite and she supports him in his quest to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Rohan poses as Pooja's friend who has come from India and Rahul agrees to let him live with them after Rohan introduces himself as "Yash" to hide his real identity: Rahul does not recognize his immensely-changed now-adult brother after so many years. At Krish's school function, when Pooja asks Krish how he got over his stage nerves, he recites some advice that Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this exact advice ten years ago, hears Krish and finally realizes that "Yash" is actually his brother.
<br>
<br>
Rohan begs Rahul to come home but he refuses, reminding him of what their father had said. Rohan invites his parents to London and arranges a covert reunion wherein he brings them all to the same mall. Nandini and Rahul share an emotional reunion. However, when Yash sees Rahul, Anjali and Pooja with Rohan, he is enraged at Rohan and their confrontation does not go well. Nandini stands up to Yash for the first time, telling him that he was wrong for disowning Rahul and did not do right by breaking the family. After their grandmother's death, Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul and Anjali to come home. Nandini gives the couple a proper welcome and Yash tearfully asks for forgiveness, telling Rahul that he had always loved him. Rohan and Pooja, who have fallen in love, are married, and the family holds a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.</h3></p>
